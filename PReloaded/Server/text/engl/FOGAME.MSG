#		Traits (with TRAIT.MSG)
#
####################################################################################################################################

# 105500
# TRAIT_FAST_METABOLISM
{105501}{}{Fast Metabolism}
{105502}{}{Your metabolic rate is twice as normal.  This means that effects of drugs and medicines wear off twice as fast, but your body heals faster (every 30s instead of every 60s).}
# TRAIT_BRUISER
{105511}{}{Bruiser}
{105512}{}{A little slower, but a little bigger.  You may not hit as often, but they will feel it when you do!  Your total action points are lowered by 2, but your Strength is increased by 4 and you deal even more damage in melee attacks.}
# TRAIT_ONE_HANDER
{105521}{}{One Hander}
{105522}{}{One of your hands is very dominant.  You excel with single-handed weapons (+20 chance to hit), but two-handed weapons cause a problem (-40 chance to hit). You do 5 extra damage with single-handed range weapons.}
# TRAIT_FINESSE
{105531}{}{Finesse}
{105532}{}{Your attacks show a lot of finesse.  You don't do as much damage (+30 target's damage resistance), but you cause more critical hits (+10 critical chance).}
# TRAIT_KAMIKAZE
{105541}{}{Kamikaze}
{105542}{}{By not paying attention to any threats. You do 10% more damage to enemies but your damage resistance is lowered by 10.}
# TRAIT_HEAVY_HANDED
{105551}{}{Heavy Handed}
{105552}{}{You swing harder, not better.  Your attacks are very brutal, but lack finesse.  You rarely cause a good critical (-20 critical power), but you always do more unarmed damage (+5 final damage). Additionally, all your close combat attacks knock down the opponent if a successful Strength roll was made.}
# TRAIT_FAST_SHOT
{105561}{}{Fast Shot}
{105562}{}{You don't have time to aim for a targeted attack, because you attack faster than normal people and your bullets can randomly hit different body parts.  It costs you one less action point for guns and thrown weapons, and then one less with two handed weapons.}
# TRAIT_BLOODY_MESS
{105571}{}{Bloody Mess}
{105572}{}{By some strange twist of fate, people around you die violently.  You always see the worst way a person can die (100% chance to kill target if your damage gets him on negative HP but you can be killed like that too).}
# TRAIT_JINXED
{105581}{}{Jinxed}
{105582}{}{The good thing is that everyone around you has more critical failures in combat, the bad thing is so do you!}
# TRAIT_GOOD_NATURED
{105591}{}{Good Natured}
{105592}{}{There is a positive aura about you. People are more likely to follow you (+50 party points), but you can't own any slaves.}
# TRAIT_CHEM_RELIANT
{105601}{}{Chem Reliant}
{105602}{}{The drug effects last twice as long, but you regain only 2/3 the normal hit points while using medicines.}
# TRAIT_BONEHEAD
{105611}{}{Bonehead}
{105612}{}{A thicker than average cranium means you can shrug off hits to the head that would floor others.  Unfortunatly that doesn't leave much room up there.}
# TRAIT_SKILLED
{105621}{}{Skilled}
{105622}{}{Since you spent more time improving your skills than a normal person, you gain 5 additional skill points per experience level. The tradeoff is that you do not gain as many extra abilities. You gain a perk every four levels.}
# TRAIT_LONER
{105631}{}{Loner}
{105632}{}{You appreciate the nature more than company of others. You gain 10% more experience, but you can't have any followers.}
# TRAIT_SMALL_FRAME
{105641}{}{Small Frame}
{105642}{}{You are not quite as big as the other ordinary man, but that never slowed you down.  You can't carry as much, but you are more agile.}
# TRAIT_CHEM_RESISTANT
{105651}{}{Chem Resistant}
{105652}{}{You are immune to drug addiction effects, but regain only half the normal hit points while using medicines.}
# TRAIT_GIFTED
{105661}{}{Gifted}
{105662}{}{You have more innate abilities than most, so you have not spent as much time honing your skills.  Your primary statistics are each +1, but you lose -10% on all skills to start, and receive 5 less skill points per level.}

|0xff706050	-- scypior

|0xff706050	-- MrLexx

|0xff706050	-- Rusty


|0xff907824 I am installing the english version of Fallout 2 right now.
After that, I need one or two people for screenshots.
|0xff706050	-- MrLexx


|0xff907824 Posing gladly, naked for money only.
|0xff706050	-- lisac


|0xff907824 Where there's a hole, there's a way.
|0xff706050	-- Rusty


|0xff907824 Did ya fix the HOLE in da wall, bitch?
|0xff706050	-- Rusty


|0xff907824 Okay, enough radiation for me today,
going back to slave business.
|0xff706050	-- Atom


|0xff907824 Why the fuck are molerats so strong?! I had metal armor
and grease gun, took 3 burst fires to kill one of the
fucks, they raped the shit out of me as if i wasn't
wearing anything at all. Fuck. Those rats are bigger
than fucking bears.
|0xff706050	-- Rusty


|0xff907824 Server crashes more often then shuts normally haha.
|0xff706050	-- scypior


|0xff907824 Some traders in Hub are missing.
|0xff706050	-- MrLexx
|0xff907824 Kidnapped, killed and buried god knows where...
we need the LYNCH MOB!
|0xff706050	-- lisac


|0xff907824 Jack is highwayman-spawning machine.
|0xff706050	-- Atom


|0xff907824 I don't like using this brain thing. It's annoying.
|0xff706050	-- MrLexx


|0xff907824 I got small penis too... but i'm THE technician.
Can do things you mortals can only dream of.
|0xff706050	-- lisac


|0xff907824 My team leader is my penis.
|0xff706050	-- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 And my GF interested after your second video -
where from SlimCharles?
|0xff706050	-- LLITiF


|0xff907824 Every girl in russia is dreaming about Lexx.
|0xff706050	-- scypior


|0xff907824 So he won't lose interest, he's strong
third party asses right now.
|0xff706050	-- Atom


|0xff907824 But talking about rape is somewhat boring.
I am not really interested in that.
|0xff706050	-- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 Eventually there will be a 6 hour cybersex with Lynette.
|0xff706050	-- SlimCharles


|0xff907824 Nevertheless, if you're full of beer you
don't mind where you piss at all.
|0xff706050	-- scypior


|0xff907824 Well, but it's simple biology.
You watch hot female, you get a hard one.
|0xff706050	-- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 Damn lesbians, didn't shut the fuck up.
|0xff706050	-- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 I am the kaizer from shaizer.
|0xff706050	-- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 Maybe we should try something similar with fonline.
|0xff706050	-- lisac


|0xff907824 Filming nerdy polaks doesn't sound that good.
|0xff706050	-- Rusty


|0xff907824 Atom you are drunked?
|0xff706050	-- cvet
|0xff907824 Nope, he's retarded.
|0xff706050	-- Rusty


|0xff907824 They should rather learn from Trotsky and make a good
deal of revolution, not this kind of pussy cat fight.
|0xff706050	-- Atom


|0xff907824 Bleh, that quest idea has become shitty now
I need something new, that is at least medium-size.
|0xff706050	-- Mrlexx
|0xff907824 My dick.
|0xff706050	-- Rusty
|0xff907824 That's not a quest, that's a joke.
|0xff706050	-- Mrlexx
|0xff907824 So I've heard.
|0xff706050	-- Rusty


|0xff907824 Scyp's designing hairstyles now.
|0xff706050	-- Solar


|0xff907824 I can't fucking believe it... The Rotators -
The most gay group in the whole universe!
|0xff706050	-- lisac


|0xff907824 He might have become gay too, while being in here.
|0xff706050	-- Ghosthack


|0xff907824 Lexx is a sex slave?
|0xff706050	-- Solar


|0xff907824 Ass too wiry.
|0xff706050	-- cvet


|0xff907824 It was hard for me to remove
"your eyes were poured by a boiling water".
|0xff706050	-- SlimCharles


|0xff907824 I met a russian, he's great. I said 'secret',
he said 'secret anal'.
|0xff706050	-- SlimCharles


|0xff907824 Need big gan. Usa man yel in ncr, his wann
maney bat me keel him and tack his item.
|0xff706050	-- Ghosthack


|0xff907824 Better teach him something that
will make him insult Lexx later.
|0xff706050	-- Atom


|0xff907824 "Russian powergamers" would be great
for a special encounter.
|0xff706050	-- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 Germany's in crysis. Time to start a war.
|0xff706050	-- scypior


|0xff907824 Man, I jammed my balls while walking.
Dunno how, but I can't sit now.
|0xff706050	-- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 It's not a true jrpg, if you don't
have a homo hero to play.
|0xff706050	-- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 Gay dinosaurs, bad idea.
|0xff706050	-- Rusty


|0xff907824 The kids should play with real guns.
|0xff706050	-- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 Fact is that homo can cook, and can cook good. Or its all just a coincidence, or there is a constant that needs deeper research.
|0xff706050	-- Wipe


|0xff907824 I will sacrifice my body to ZAX.
|0xff706050	-- Wipe


|0xff907824 No, its cultural program.
|0xff706050	-- cvet


|0xff907824 I see lisac is almost working.
|0xff706050	-- scypior


|0xff907824 My kitchen looks like ass.
|0xff706050	-- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 I'm already crazy... town_h.fos, enough said.
|0xff706050	-- Ghosthack


|0xff907824 Therefore a little bit oil is enough to get the job done.
|0xff706050	-- MrLexx


|0xff907824 Can be solved by timeout.
|0xff706050	-- Ghosthack


|0xff907824 Why do you complicate my life
|0xff706050	-- scypior
|0xff907824 I love to complicate your life. When i woke up this morning, i thought
"Hm. I should complicate scyps life a bit today"
|0xff706050	-- MrLexx


|0xff907824 I steal from rich devs and give other stuff to poor devs.
I am Robin Hood of coding.
|0xff706050	-- Atom


|0xff907824 What the- I tested it, I swear!
|0xff706050	-- Wipe


|0xff907824 Bots!
|0xff706050	-- Atom
|0xff907824 Perl.
|0xff706050	-- Wipe
|0xff907824 Evil.
What these three words have in common?
|0xff706050	-- Atom
|0xff907824 Where bot is the question, Perl is the answer.
|0xff706050	-- Wipe
|0xff907824 Evil is the result!
|0xff706050	-- MrLexx


|0xff907824 I just want red head girl, damn the lack of progress!
|0xff706050	-- Solar


|0xff907824 It's incredibly stupid, complicated and it doesn't work.
|0xff706050	-- Lisac


|0xff907824 I make more sense than players even when drunk, so it's ok.
|0xff706050	-- Solar


|0xff907824 Ah, Rotators. Music, physics, links to weird porn, bad jokes about jobs
that we have, or don't have, and occasionally some words about FOnline!
|0xff706050	-- Atom


|0xff907824 My bed needs some rage.
|0xff706050	-- Ghosthack
|0xff907824 Was it pick-up line?
|0xff706050	-- Wipe


|0xff907824 I would love to have a black girlfriend. This makes you totally a hipster.
|0xff706050	-- MrLexx


|0xff907824 When something doesn't make sense in FOnline. Just ask yourself:
"Is it a bug?" No...
"Is it a feature?" No...
Then it's prehistoric stuff.
|0xff706050	-- Mayck


|0xff907824 I should proceed with that, as vals hater.
|0xff706050	-- Wipe
|0xff907824 Vals, rats, what else?
|0xff706050	-- Atom
|0xff907824 Beer.
|0xff706050	-- Wipe
|0xff907824 There's a lot of hate inside you. To anger this leads, and anger leads
to the dark side. Can't we just all hate JavaScript? And only that.
I'm joking of course.
Why hate something that is unending source of amusement.
|0xff706050	-- Atom


|0xff907824 Almost any engine problem can be solved by spawning more items.
|0xff706050	-- JovankaB


|0xff907824 Uncrustify destroyed drugs_data.fos, it looks like space invaders now.
|0xff706050	-- Atom
